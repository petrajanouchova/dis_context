In Greece: adoption and adaptation of cultural practices, selected ritual provided a field of interaction especially among elites. Shared pratices (xenia, symposion, gift-giving, festivals).

Middle ground created shared space - hybrid culture. Very instable and changing.
The theory emphasises the agency and self-determination of indigenes.

Middle ground - panethnic sanctuaries.

Networking the Middle ground:
no center, networks create the Greek world. The networks are multiple and multicultural and multiethnic.
Multiple middle grounds, coastal areas -edges to the network, creating middle ground between Greeks and locals.
Panhellenic santuaries are hubs.
Malkin ignores flows of artists, mobile individuals, specialists, poets.

The conclusion says everything is entangled together.},

  Abstract                 = {In 1999, fieldwork was resumed by the British team at Adzhiyska Vodenitsa, Vetren, the site of an inland emporion which has been identified with ancient Pistiros (SEG 43- 486, 46. 872*). Excavations were conducted on the terrace with architectural remains in two sectors, north and south of the main east-west road. In the northern sector, 22 pits were investigated. The faunal material from these pits reveals specific butchering methods and the re-articulation of complete body parts following butchery. Among the finds are graffiti on pottery, including a votive inscription to Zeus. In the southern sector, there are traces of residential use. The report includes an account of geophysical prospection to determine the nature of land use beyond the terrace, with evidence suggesting that the settlement was directly adjacent to the River Maritsa (ancient Hebros). /// Το 1999, $\eta$ $\beta$$\rho$$\epsilon$$\tau$$\alpha$$\nu$$\iota$$\kappa$ή ο$\mu$ά$\delta$$\alpha$ $\epsilon$$\pi$$\alpha$$\nu$έ$\lambda$$\alpha$$\beta$$\epsilon$ $\tau$$\eta$$\nu$ $\epsilon$$\rho$$\gamma$$\alpha$$\sigma$ί$\alpha$ $\pi$$\epsilon$$\delta$ίο$\upsilon$ $\sigma$$\tau$$\eta$$\nu$ Adzhiyska Vodenitsa ο$\tau$ο Vetren, $\theta$έ$\sigma$$\eta$ $\epsilon$$\nu$ός $\mu$$\epsilon$$\sigma$ό$\gamma$$\epsilon$$\iota$ο$\upsilon$ $\epsilon$$\mu$$\pi$ο$\rho$ίο$\upsilon$, $\tau$ο ο$\pi$οίο έ$\chi$$\epsilon$$\iota$ $\tau$$\alpha$$\upsilon$$\tau$$\iota$$\sigma$$\theta$$\epsilon$ί $\mu$$\epsilon$ $\tau$ο$\nu$ $\alpha$$\rho$$\chi$$\alpha$ίο $\Pi$ί$\sigma$$\tau$$\iota$$\rho$ο (SEG 43. 486; 46. 872*).

We focus here on the relative dating of artefacts during archaeological fieldwork, with particular emphasis on new ways to express and analyse chronological uncertainty. A probabilistic method for assigning artefacts to particular chronological periods is advocated and implemented for a large pottery dataset from an intensive survey of the Greek island of Antikythera. We also highlight several statistical methods for exploring how uncertainty is shared amongst different periods in this dataset and how these observed associations can prompt more sensitive interpretations of landscape-scale patterns. The concluding discussion re-emphasises why these issues are relevant to wider methodological debates in archaeological field practice.},

  Abstract                 = {Intro Paragraph: Signaling theory provides an opportunity to integrate an interac- tive theory of symbolic communication and social benefit with materialist theories of individual strategic action and adaptation. This article examines the potential explanatory value of signal- ing theory for a variety of anthropological topics, focusing on three social arenas in which signaling might plausibly be impor- tant: unconditional generosity, “wasteful” subsistence behavior, and artistic or craft traditions. In each case, it outlines the ways in which the phenomena correspond with the expectations of signaling theory by showing how a given pattern of action might signal particular hidden attributes, provide benefits to both sig- naler and observers, and meet the conditions for honest commu- nication. The ethnographic evidence suggests that the fundamen- tal conditions for reliable signaling of condition-dependent qualities may exist in many social domains. It appears that sig- naling theory has considerable promise for generating novel and powerful insights into the ethnographic realm....},

Human practice and lifestyle is a product of habitus - the combination of stuctured and structuring structure, the worldview of individual. Habitus is influenced and formed based on external conditions (climate, income, health, social groups, economic situation). I.e. we are predisposed to have ceratin lifestyle, formed by the external conditions around us. Lifestyle is systematic product of habitus. p. 173: the Habitus is reflected in the materail products of our lifestyle. Personal taste is just a product of habitus - set of distinctive preferences. Isolated features and material objects does not help to discover the individual habitus - it has to be a collection. p.175: Habitus constantly gererates sets of choices constituting lifesyle. Chnages in external conditions{\textgreater} adjustment of habitus{\textgreater} change of personal taste and te lifestyle. p. 176: People: economically and culturally rich, poor and the middle ones (the pretentious ones, trying to be the rich ones, manifest discrepancy between ambition and posibilities).},

p.116 Special trading sites of this sort are administered by the native {\'{e}}lite, but are inhabited and frequented mostly by alien merchants. They are usually located in places apart from the normal residential settlements, and special conditions prevail which make them neutral ground for the two trading parties, where their personal safety and fair conditions for trading are guaranteed.

-evolution toward more complex society happened due to the influence fo Greeks, but very slowly

Dietler, ch. 6: Greeks and Etruscans
-centre-periphery model does not explain all that was happening, it can be useful in some cases, but mostly it os oversimplification of the past, therefore it distorts the picture more than it helps to interpret it
-p.132: The model convincingly demonstrates how redistribution of prestige items may have been used by Hallstatt chiefs to consolidate and expand political power, but the burial data used to test the model seem to show that the principal objects used in this redistribution network were indigenously produced rather than imported from the Mediterranean.
-p.137: The ostentatious concentration of spectacular luxury items in a few Hallstatt tombs clustered around settlements with presumed central economic and political functions corresponds well with the type of economy in which external trade is controlled and manipulated by a political {\'{e}}lite (Frankenstein {\&} Rowlands 1978).},

  Abstract                 = {Revision of the author's thesis (DPhil--Oxford University, 2002) presented under title: The dance of the islands: perceptions of insularity in classical Greece. This book examines the history of the Aegean islands and the changing concepts of insularity in the late archaic and classical period, with particular emphasis on the 5th century and the period of Athenian imperial control over the Aegean world. The predominant presence of islands in the Aegean geographic landscape inevitably created a variety of different and sometimes even conflicting perceptions of insularity. Using the theoretical concept of network, the book examines the religious networks of the insular world of the Aegean (Calauria and Delos) and their later transformation into networks of imperial control for 5th-century Athens. Athenian control over the islands transformed the concept of insularity in Greek thought and even provided powerful imagery for Athenian self-representation, exemplified in the metaphor of the ‘island of Athens'. Imperial Athens may have strengthened some aspects of the concept of insularity, such as ‘weak island' or ‘safe island', but beyond imperial politics, there also lay a world of frequent interaction outside the sphere of mainstream political narrative. The book examines the cases of island-networking on a micro-political and economic level, as well the interaction between islands and their mainland dependencies, the peraiai.},

A probabilistic method is proposed as a potential solution for modelling and quantifying time when high levels of uncertainty restricts temporal knowledge and scientific datings are unavailable, while Monte Carlo simulation is suggested as a means to formally integrate such knowledge into actual analysis. A case study focusing on counts of prehistoric hunter–gatherer pithouses in Mid-Holocene Japan provides an example of how uncertainty can be problematic and bias the results of the most straightforward archaeological analysis and how the coupling of a probabilistic and simulation-based approach nonetheless offers a useful solution. The discussion that follows also addresses the need for more robust and quantifiable ways to illustrate the chronological flow of our archaeological narratives.},

Analyzing archaeological data and ancient texts, Michael Dietler explores these colonial encounters over six centuries, focusing on material culture, urban landscapes, economic practices, and forms of violence. He shows how selective consumption linked native societies and colonists and created transformative relationships for each. Archaeologies of Colonialism also examines the role these ancient encounters played in the formation of modern European identity, colonial ideology, and practices, enumerating the problems for archaeologists attempting to re-examine these past societies.}

  Abstract                 = {The possibility of exploring ethnic identities in past societies constitutes one of the most controversial fields of archaeological research. However, the reassessment of the conceptualization of ethnicity in the human sciences and the increasing transference of these theories to archaeological research is helping to develop new analytical frameworks for the study of this problematic subject. From this perspective, the aim of this paper is to attempt a theoretical and methodological approach to the complex relationships between ethnic identity and material remains from the standpoint of Iron Age studies, showing both the possibilities and difficulties of archaeological research on ethnicity. For this period, the incipient availability of written evidence allows the development of new interdisciplinary research strategies. Finally, an introduction to practical work in this field is presented, specifically focusing on two case studies: Ruiz Zapatero and {\{}{\'{A}}{\}}lvarez-Sanch{\{}{\'{i}}{\}}s' approach to the identity of the Vetto...},

  Abstract                 = {Giddens in his careful study of imperial China has argued that pre-modern states were not really territorial (as we have seen, reference to the "territory" of the Sinhala-Buddhist "nation" in the past has legitimised current claims to the territory in Sri Lanka), pre-modern states lacked the administrative and military infrastructures necessary. Moreover, "traditional" states had frontiers rather than borders. Thus, the Weberian definition of the state as an institution that possesses a monopoly to the legitimate use of force within a territorial domain, according to Giddens, is appropriate only to the modern European state. Gellner (1983) has taken this argument further. In "Nations and Nationalism", Gellner has argued that in agrarian or pre-industrial society there was no homogeneity of culture. Rather, society consisted of horizontally stratified ruling, administrative and commercial classes over "laterally insulated communities". What Gellner's argument shows, is that there was no congruence between cultural and political unities in pre-industrial Sri Lanka (Nissan and Stirrat 1987), counter to what is argued by the two-nation or primordialist theories of Sri Lanka's history. "Nationalism is not what it seems, and above all it is not what it seems to itself. The cultures it claims to defend and to revive is often its own inventions, or are modified out of all recognition" (Gellner 1983:56) Harrell-Bond/Voutira (1992): Traces the history of this century's refugees to the replacement of the old multi-ethnic European empires by the new world order of sovereign nation states, where: "Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to flee their homes because they did not 'belong', they did not fit the nationalist principle of 'one state, one culture' (Gellner 1983) and thus could not be accomodated within European national state borders" (pp. 2).},

Ian Gregory and Paul Ell present the first study comprehensively to define this emerging field, exploring all aspects of using GIS in historical research. A GIS is a form of database in which every item of data is linked to a spatial location. This technology offers unparalleled opportunities to add insight and rejuvenate historical research through the ability to identify and use the geographical characteristics of data. Historical GIS introduces the basic concepts and tools underpinning GIS technology, describing and critically assessing the visualisation, analytical and e-science methodologies that it enables and examining key scholarship where GIS has been used to enhance research debates. The result is a clear agenda charting how GIS will develop as one of the most important approaches to scholarship in historical geography.},

  Abstract                 = {Incest, polygamy, murder, sacrilege, impalement, castration, female power, and despotism: these are some of the images by which the Greek tragedians defined the non-Greek, `barbarian' world. This book explains for the first time the reasons behind their singular fascination with barbarians. It sets the plays against the historical background of the Panhellenic wars against Persia and the establishment of an Athenian empire based on democracy and slavery. Contemporary anthropology and political philosophy is discussed, revealing how the poets conceptualized the barbarian as the negative embodiment of Athenian civic ideals. By comparing the treatment of foreigners in Homer and tragedy, it shows that the new dimension which the idea of the barbarian had brought to the tragic theatre radically affected the past, and enriched the tragedians' repertoire of aural and visual effects. The invented barbarian of the tragic stage was a powerful cultural expression of Greek xenophobia and chauvinism, but, paradoxically, produced an outburst of creative energy and literary innovation. The D.Phil. dissertation out of which this book developed won the Hellenic Foundation's prize for the best doctoral thesis in ancient Greek studies in the UK and Republic of Ireland (1988).},

Good overview of acculturation theory - builds on Cusick. Syncretism - should be used only for religion, but some archaeologists misuse this term. L. thinks hybridity has more to offer than the previous theories: it can be rather seen as analytical tool than description of the phenomenon.},
  Annote                   = {Acculturation - by use of material, we cannot say whether people adopted also identity. Epigraphy would be more helpful, except it does not speak about Greek or Thracian identity.

Syncretism - active role, creation of new symbolic religious system, based on both interacting systems, that do not resemble. Ignores colonial domination of the colonizer.

Bricolage - negotiation between two different cultural traditions, having to choose and adapt it. Colonizers dominate the contact.

Creolization - focusing on the changes at the culture of teh colonizer; creation of common cultural vocabulary in a situation of dislocation or diaspora.

Mestizaje - Mestizaje implies the development of a single, unitary culture, but the fact remains that in the seventeenth century there were many different social groups, distinct ethnic identities, and dissimilar cultural formations among the peoples living in New Mexico.

Hybridity - emphasis on resistance, mockery and ambivalence. It stresses the gency of the colonised and their response to the colonisation.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.}

Seuthopolis became a military headquarters{\textgreater} Seuthes III built the city to secure his status as a princely figure amongst other local people. (p. 119) The society was non-homogenous: Greeks, Thracians and maybe Macedonians living in the city. Greek was used as a language of communication between elites and locals, traders and craftsmen.

  Abstract                 = {Lead sling bullets are often inscribed with the personal names of military commanders of a unit of slingers. Archaeological sites that have yielded such projectiles provide an opportunity to link the names attested with historical figures known from literary sources. A classic example presents the city of Olynthus that was besieged and taken through treachery by the troops of Philip II of Macedon in 348 BC. Irrefutable evidence of this is provided by the hundreds of sling bullets bearing his name, along with those of several commanders from his army, such as Hipponikos, Potalos, Kleoboulos and Anaxandros. The present article evaluates the significance of inscribed sling bullets as a basic source in reconstructing historical events related to the Macedonian expan- sion in Thrace during the reign of Philip II. Through the discussion of a number of examples from Thrace, Macedonia and Northern Aegean, including previously unpublished finds, I argue that these objects can serve as a reliable marker of Macedonian mobility abroad. As a major source on the subject I further analyze the pri- mary data generated as a result of the recent archaeological excavations of the Thracian fortified complex near Kozi Gramadi, located in south central Bulgaria. On a broader level, the present survey aims to reinforce the value of sling bullets as a necessary object of study which on account of their multi-layered nature should invite the application of an integrated approach towards antiquity by combining data from archaeology, history and epigraphy},

Danov 1990, Archibald 1998, Isaac 1986, Owen 2000. The model of Hellenization used by Bulgarian archaeologist and politicians alike to claim a place for Bulgaria in the heart of Europe's Hellenic heritage (Zhivkova 1986, Owen 2000). It denies any agency of Thracians.
Model: violent Thracians, civilized by Greeks, influenced by Greek literary sources.

Change of social structure in Thrace in 8th c. BC - emergence of Thracian elites, appropriation of iron, and techniques. Imports Greek, Scythian, Baltic, Levantine are result of contacts with other cultures. Owen argues that contact with Greeks lead to social change (technology, contact, trade). The contacts between Thracians and Greeks are far more compelx than Greek literary sources claim.

  Abstract                 = {This article considers the incorporation of part of Britain into the Roman empire in the context of globalization theory and world-systems history. Emphasis is placed on the local effects of the expansion of global systems and their impact on the social practices of eating and drinking at a range of settlements in the southeast of Britain in the Iron Age to Roman transition, c. 50 BC-AD 200. Through the analysis of consumption practices via quantitative pottery assemblage data, it is argued that globalization offers a more sophisticated framework to describe change than current archaeological approaches to Romanization and identity. The results show that while much of the populace was subject to a progressively homogenizing supply of food-related pottery vessels, the use of such technologies was negotiated within social practices drawing on the integration of both local and global cultural elements. Such findings highlight the potential of critical applications of globalization theory to conceptualize economic, social, and cultural changes in Roman provincial societies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This book contends that the rift between the 'Greek East' and the 'Roman West' is more a product of the traditional separation of Roman and Greek history than a reflection of the Hellenistic-period Mediterranean, which was a strongly interconnected cultural and economic zone, with the rising Roman republic just one among many powers in the region, east and west. The contributors argue for a dynamic reading of the economy, politics and history of the central and western Mediterranean beyond Rome, and in doing so problematise the concepts of 'East', 'West' and 'Hellenistic' itself.},

  Abstract                 = {Mode of interaction between the two autonomous and independent political units on the same level, located next to each other. The interaction include: imitation, eulation, competition, warfare, exchange of material goods and interaction. The dominance of one polity over another is not focal point of this approach, alyhough it is one of the possible modes of contact. Autonomous unit: village, tribal unit, chiefdom, city, state, empire. The term polity is not dependent on the level of social complexity of the autonomous political-unit. The polity - the highest form of socio-political organisation in the given region (often village or tribe). More complex polities have form of social hierarchy - they may consist of old polities that merged under one authority. Polity does not need ot be distinguished by developed system of governmnet or administration. The procedures of decision making have to habitually work, and such decisions have to be respected by the members of the polity. The adjacent small polities often share a number of features: language, symbolic systems, including belief, therefore they are not easily recoverable by means of archaeology. Change is caused by internal or external factors (endogenous and exogenous agent): Exogenous: diffusion of culture, core/periphery. Endogenous: internal growth etc. Peer polity: between the two, the change is happening within the polity, but it has effect also to neighbourhooding polities. The changes are more or less contemporary, and it is hard to track the original polity (the= single locus of innovation). Such changes include architectural style, conceptual systems of commmunication information (writing, system of measures), assemblages of specific and special artefacts which may be associated with high status in the society in question, customs (ritual practices). The mode of interaction: a) competition and competitive emulation b) symbolic entrainment, transmission of innovation c) increased flow in the exchange of goods. Nature of interactions: * warfare * competitive emulation - display of wealth and power to achieve higher inter-polity status, immitation of neighbour in a greater manner, conspicuous consumption and display * symbolic entrainment - developed symbolic system adopted by other the less developed one, writing, systems of measures, social organisation, political system, adopted to bring an advantage and prestige. * transmission of innovation - innovations not of a symbolic nature, technology * increased flow and exchange of goods - import, creation of new institutions to cope with the reception, allocation and distribution; craft specialization}

  Abstract                 = {Spanning one-ninth of the earth's circumference across three continents, the Roman Empire ruled a quarter of humanity through complex networks of political power, military domination and economic exchange. These extensive connections were sustained by premodern transportation and communication technologies that relied on energy generated by human and animal bodies, winds, and currents. Conventional maps that represent this world as it appears from space signally fail to capture the severe environmental constraints that governed the flows of people, goods and information. Cost, rather than distance, is the principal determinant of connectivity. For the first time, ORBIS allows us to express Roman communication costs in terms of both time and expense. By simulating movement along the principal routes of the Roman road network, the main navigable rivers, and hundreds of sea routes in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and coastal Atlantic, this interactive model reconstructs the duration and financial cost of travel in antiquity. Taking account of seasonal variation and accommodating a wide range of modes and means of transport, ORBIS reveals the true shape of the Roman world and provides a unique resource for our understanding of premodern history.},

  Abstract                 = {Stein's introduction summarizes the key concepts of the colonial encounters and the modes of contact between the coloniser and the colonised. He stresses the importance of indigenous agency, as one of the elements of the cross-cultural encounter, which has been often neglected in the past (acculturation, world systems theory). The second focus of the book is identity of people in contact and the influnce of the colonial contacts that have formed new forms of identity (hybridization, Dommelen). Instead of unilateral interpretation of the archaeological data (from the point of view of the dominant coloniser, authors offer an analysis of bi-/multilateral approach to the social groups in contact, interpreted via surviving material culture.(Dietler) The archaeological material is percieved as illuminating the conscious processed and habitus of the daily life - therefore reflecting potential culture contact and changes within the society. The active role of local people in formation process. One universal theory that would cover all aspects of cultural exchange and contact does not exists - all theories are very specific to given circumstances and cannot be universally applied to all colonial encounters. The modes of interaction become in the latest scholarly debate more diverse than they used to be (domination, long-term competition, alliance). The emulation of foreign elements of culture by local elites in order to adopt the status of exotic imports may be one of the explanation of the presence of foreign objects in local culture - the artefacts then are found only in the elite contexts (public) and are not universally accepted by the local population (do no appear in domestic context). Populationwith non-elite status retain the local customs and styles, technologies. Foreign elements in the indigenous culture may be also result of trade - applicable to archaeological material, vessels etc.},
  Annote                   = {-p.6: Archaeological data illuminate the unconscious processes and h a b i t u s of daily life, thereby complementing the ideologically charged infor- mation provided by historical sources.
-p. 7: importance of indigenous agency in colonial systems—that is, the idea that local groups play a key role in structuring interaction. At the same time, anthropological archaeologists have begun to question the uni- versal applicability of the European-based world-system model to non- Western and precapitalist colonial networks
p. 8: Recognizing that the world systems and acculturation models apply to only a small subset of culture contact situations, researchers are now making a conscious effort to define interregional interaction in ways that incorporate a broad range of variation including long-distance trade, colonial situations, and military expansion. By doing this, we can now start to move beyond simple typologies of interaction, and instead we can start to focus on the variables and processes that explain why the organization and effects of culture contact can be expected to vary under different structural conditions and historical contingencies (Schortman and Urban 1998; Stein 1998).
****
From pos-tprocessual theory, we see a concern with agency, practice, i d e o l o g y, the active role of material culture in negotiating cultural identity, and the importance of historical contingency. Key processual elements include a recognition of the importance of political economy, a comparative analytical framework, and a concern with explicit, replic- able methodologies that use data to evaluate broader theoretical propositions.},

I argue that the vessels belonged to the treasury of Seuthes III. The inscriptions, which indicate that the vessels were weighed against coins on the Alexandrian/Attic standard, were inscribed when the vessels were acquired, or as part of later audits of the treasury. Compared to the inscriptions on silver plate from the treasuries of earlier Odrysian kings, these are rather practical and devoid of political message. This difference is the result of the political changes in Thrace that followed the Macedonian expansion.}

The main topic is the social identity of people in the past, and how they were influenced by contact (migration, colonial encounters and trade/exchange). The traditional approach (focus on coloniser the dominant): Boardman, Tsetskhaldze. Identity often studied one-dimensionaly (ethnicity, gender). COntact enable to formulate new hybrid identities. Present study want to evaluate how the study of materiality can offer insights to colonal experiences, and how mobility impact colonial and local identites.}

  Abstract                 = {This book is a study of the process conventionally termed 'Romanization' through an investigation of the experience of Rome's Gallic provinces in the late Republic and early empire. Beginning with a rejection of the concept of 'Romanization' it describes the nature of Roman power in Gaul and the Romans' own understanding of these changes. Successive chapters then map the chronology and geography of change and offer new interpretations of urbanism, rural civilization, consumption and cult, before concluding with a synoptic view of Gallo-Roman civilization and of the origins of provincial cultures in general. The work draws on literary and archaeological material to make a contribution to the cultural history of the empire which will be of interest to ancient historians, classical archaeologists and all interested in cultural change.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Revisionist studies of Roman imperialism and Romanization continue to show the traces of modern debates on imperialism and colonialism, in particular a tendency to analyse cultural change in terms of the interaction of two ethnic cultures. An analysis of the changing unities and diversities of cultures in Gaul (modern France), and of the transformation of Roman culture during and as a result of imperial expansion, suggests a new view of the nature and genesis of Roman imperial culture.},
