abstract = {The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.},

I argue that the vessels belonged to the treasury of Seuthes III. The inscriptions, which indicate that the vessels were weighed against coins on the Alexandrian/Attic standard, were inscribed when the vessels were acquired, or as part of later audits of the treasury. Compared to the inscriptions on silver plate from the treasuries of earlier Odrysian kings, these are rather practical and devoid of political message. This difference is the result of the political changes in Thrace that followed the Macedonian expansion.},

@article{Nankov2015b,
abstract = {Lead sling bullets are often inscribed with the personal names of military commanders of a unit of slingers. Archaeological sites that have yielded such projectiles provide an opportunity to link the names attested with historical figures known from literary sources. A classic example presents the city of Olynthus that was besieged and taken through treachery by the troops of Philip II of Macedon in 348 BC. Irrefutable evidence of this is provided by the hundreds of sling bullets bearing his name, along with those of several commanders from his army, such as Hipponikos, Potalos, Kleoboulos and Anaxandros. The present article evaluates the significance of inscribed sling bullets as a basic source in reconstructing historical events related to the Macedonian expan- sion in Thrace during the reign of Philip II. Through the discussion of a number of examples from Thrace, Macedonia and Northern Aegean, including previously unpublished finds, I argue that these objects can serve as a reliable marker of Macedonian mobility abroad. As a major source on the subject I further analyze the pri- mary data generated as a result of the recent archaeological excavations of the Thracian fortified complex near Kozi Gramadi, located in south central Bulgaria. On a broader level, the present survey aims to reinforce the value of sling bullets as a necessary object of study which on account of their multi-layered nature should invite the application of an integrated approach towards antiquity by combining data from archaeology, history and epigraphy},

Creolization - focusing on the changes at the culture of teh colonizer; creation of common cultural vocabulary in a situation of dislocation or diaspora.

The contributors argue for a dynamic reading of the economy, politics and history of the central and western Mediterranean beyond Rome, and in doing so problematise the concepts of 'East', 'West' and 'Hellenistic' itself.},

A probabilistic method is proposed as a potential solution for modelling and quantifying time when high levels of uncertainty restricts temporal knowledge and scientific datings are unavailable, while Monte Carlo simulation is suggested as a means to formally integrate such knowledge into actual analysis. A case study focusing on counts of prehistoric hunter–gatherer pithouses in Mid-Holocene Japan provides an example of how uncertainty can be problematic and bias the results of the most straightforward archaeological analysis and how the coupling of a probabilistic and simulation-based approach nonetheless offers a useful solution. The discussion that follows also addresses the need for more robust and quantifiable ways to illustrate the chronological flow of our archaeological narratives.},

Seuthopolis became a military headquarters{\textgreater} Seuthes III built the city to secure his status as a princely figure amongst other local people. (p. 119) The society was non-homogenous: Greeks, Thracians and maybe Macedonians living in the city. Greek was used as a language of communication between elites and locals, traders and craftsmen.

abstract = {Spanning one-ninth of the earth's circumference across three continents, the Roman Empire ruled a quarter of humanity through complex networks of political power, military domination and economic exchange. These extensive connections were sustained by premodern transportation and communication technologies that relied on energy generated by human and animal bodies, winds, and currents. Conventional maps that represent this world as it appears from space signally fail to capture the severe environmental constraints that governed the flows of people, goods and information. Cost, rather than distance, is the principal determinant of connectivity. For the first time, ORBIS allows us to express Roman communication costs in terms of both time and expense. By simulating movement along the principal routes of the Roman road network, the main navigable rivers, and hundreds of sea routes in the Mediterranean, Black Sea and coastal Atlantic, this interactive model reconstructs the duration and financial cost of travel in antiquity. Taking account of seasonal variation and accommodating a wide range of modes and means of transport, ORBIS reveals the true shape of the Roman world and provides a unique resource for our understanding of premodern history.},

He shows how selective consumption linked native societies and colonists and created transformative relationships for each.

abstract = {This article considers the incorporation of part of Britain into the Roman empire in the context of globalization theory and world-systems history. Emphasis is placed on the local effects of the expansion of global systems and their impact on the social practices of eating and drinking at a range of settlements in the southeast of Britain in the Iron Age to Roman transition, c. 50 BC-AD 200. Through the analysis of consumption practices via quantitative pottery assemblage data, it is argued that globalization offers a more sophisticated framework to describe change than current archaeological approaches to Romanization and identity. The results show that while much of the populace was subject to a progressively homogenizing supply of food-related pottery vessels, the use of such technologies was negotiated within social practices drawing on the integration of both local and global cultural elements. Such findings highlight the potential of critical applications of globalization theory to conceptualize economic, social, and cultural changes in Roman provincial societies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This book examines the history of the Aegean islands and the changing concepts of insularity in the late archaic and classical period, with particular emphasis on the 5th century and the period of Athenian imperial control over the Aegean world. The predominant presence of islands in the Aegean geographic landscape inevitably created a variety of different and sometimes even conflicting perceptions of insularity. Using the theoretical concept of network, the book examines the religious networks of the insular world of the Aegean (Calauria and Delos) and their later transformation into networks of imperial control for 5th-century Athens. Athenian control over the islands transformed the concept of insularity in Greek thought and even provided powerful imagery for Athenian self-representation, exemplified in the metaphor of the ‘island of Athens'. Imperial Athens may have strengthened some aspects of the concept of insularity, such as ‘weak island' or ‘safe island', but beyond imperial politics, there also lay a world of frequent interaction outside the sphere of mainstream political narrative. The book examines the cases of island-networking on a micro-political and economic level, as well the interaction between islands and their mainland dependencies, the peraiai.},

This article examines the potential explanatory value of signal- ing theory for a variety of anthropological topics, focusing on three social arenas in which signaling might plausibly be impor- tant: unconditional generosity, “wasteful” subsistence behavior, and artistic or craft traditions. In each case, it outlines the ways in which the phenomena correspond with the expectations of signaling theory by showing how a given pattern of action might signal particular hidden attributes, provide benefits to both sig- naler and observers, and meet the conditions for honest commu- nication. The ethnographic evidence suggests that the fundamen- tal conditions for reliable signaling of condition-dependent qualities may exist in many social domains. It appears that sig- naling theory has considerable promise for generating novel and powerful insights into the ethnographic realm....},

abstract = {Stein's introduction summarizes the key concepts of the colonial encounters and the modes of contact between the coloniser and the colonised. He stresses the importance of indigenous agency, as one of the elements of the cross-cultural encounter, which has been often neglected in the past (acculturation, world systems theory). The second focus of the book is identity of people in contact and the influnce of the colonial contacts that have formed new forms of identity (hybridization, Dommelen). Instead of unilateral interpretation of the archaeological data (from the point of view of the dominant coloniser, authors offer an analysis of bi-/multilateral approach to the social groups in contact, interpreted via surviving material culture.(Dietler) The archaeological material is percieved as illuminating the conscious processed and habitus of the daily life - therefore reflecting potential culture contact and changes within the society. The active role of local people in formation process. One universal theory that would cover all aspects of cultural exchange and contact does not exists - all theories are very specific to given circumstances and cannot be universally applied to all colonial encounters. The modes of interaction become in the latest scholarly debate more diverse than they used to be (domination, long-term competition, alliance). The emulation of foreign elements of culture by local elites in order to adopt the status of exotic imports may be one of the explanation of the presence of foreign objects in local culture - the artefacts then are found only in the elite contexts (public) and are not universally accepted by the local population (do no appear in domestic context). Populationwith non-elite status retain the local customs and styles, technologies. Foreign elements in the indigenous culture may be also result of trade - applicable to archaeological material, vessels etc.},

-p. 7: importance of indigenous agency in colonial systems—that is, the idea that local groups play a key role in structuring interaction. At the same time, anthropological archaeologists have begun to question the uni- versal applicability of the European-based world-system model to non- Western and precapitalist colonial networks
p. 8: Recognizing that the world systems and acculturation models apply to only a small subset of culture contact situations, researchers are now making a conscious effort to define interregional interaction in ways that incorporate a broad range of variation including long-distance trade, colonial situations, and military expansion. By doing this, we can now start to move beyond simple typologies of interaction, and instead we can start to focus on the variables and processes that explain why the organization and effects of culture contact can be expected to vary under different structural conditions and historical contingencies (Schortman and Urban 1998; Stein 1998).
****
From pos-tprocessual theory, we see a concern with agency, practice, i d e o l o g y, the active role of material culture in negotiating cultural identity, and the importance of historical contingency. Key processual elements include a recognition of the importance of political economy, a comparative analytical framework, and a concern with explicit, replic- able methodologies that use data to evaluate broader theoretical propositions.},

Hellenisation - based on modern colonialism and concept of acculturation, Jones 1997,33.
p.14 - Hellenization embeded in modern countries with ancient remains discourse (as need to define their own identity), nationalist ideologies.
p. 15 - core/periphery models: Frankesntein {\&} Rowlands 1978, based on Wallerstein.

p.18-21: example of Greek colonisation in Thrace
Danov 1990, Archibald 1998, Isaac 1986, Owen 2000. The model of Hellenization used by Bulgarian archaeologist and politicians alike to claim a place for Bulgaria in the heart of Europe's Hellenic heritage (Zhivkova 1986, Owen 2000). It denies any agency of Thracians.
Model: violent Thracians, civilized by Greeks, influenced by Greek literary sources.

Change of social structure in Thrace in 8th c. BC - emergence of Thracian elites, appropriation of iron, and techniques. Imports Greek, Scythian, Baltic, Levantine are result of contacts with other cultures. Owen argues that contact with Greeks lead to social change (technology, contact, trade). The contacts between Thracians and Greeks are far more compelx than Greek literary sources claim.

-trade via emporia or intermediaries
p.116 Special trading sites of this sort are administered by the native {\'{e}}lite, but are inhabited and frequented mostly by alien merchants. They are usually located in places apart from the normal residential settlements, and special conditions prevail which make them neutral ground for the two trading parties, where their personal safety and fair conditions for trading are guaranteed.

-evolution toward more complex society happened due to the influence fo Greeks, but very slowly

Dietler, ch. 6: Greeks and Etruscans
-centre-periphery model does not explain all that was happening, it can be useful in some cases, but mostly it os oversimplification of the past, therefore it distorts the picture more than it helps to interpret it
-p.132: The model convincingly demonstrates how redistribution of prestige items may have been used by Hallstatt chiefs to consolidate and expand political power, but the burial data used to test the model seem to show that the principal objects used in this redistribution network were indigenously produced rather than imported from the Mediterranean.
-p.137: The ostentatious concentration of spectacular luxury items in a few Hallstatt tombs clustered around settlements with presumed central economic and political functions corresponds well with the type of economy in which external trade is controlled and manipulated by a political {\'{e}}lite (Frankenstein {\&} Rowlands 1978).},

Successive chapters then map the chronology and geography of change and offer new interpretations of urbanism, rural civilization, consumption and cult, before concluding with a synoptic view of Gallo-Roman civilization and of the origins of provincial cultures in general. The work draws on literary and archaeological material to make a contribution to the cultural history of the empire which will be of interest to ancient historians, classical archaeologists and all interested in cultural change.},

abstract = {Incest, polygamy, murder, sacrilege, impalement, castration, female power, and despotism: these are some of the images by which the Greek tragedians defined the non-Greek, `barbarian' world. This book explains for the first time the reasons behind their singular fascination with barbarians. It sets the plays against the historical background of the Panhellenic wars against Persia and the establishment of an Athenian empire based on democracy and slavery. Contemporary anthropology and political philosophy is discussed, revealing how the poets conceptualized the barbarian as the negative embodiment of Athenian civic ideals. By comparing the treatment of foreigners in Homer and tragedy, it shows that the new dimension which the idea of the barbarian had brought to the tragic theatre radically affected the past, and enriched the tragedians' repertoire of aural and visual effects. The invented barbarian of the tragic stage was a powerful cultural expression of Greek xenophobia and chauvinism, but, paradoxically, produced an outburst of creative energy and literary innovation. The D.Phil. dissertation out of which this book developed won the Hellenic Foundation's prize for the best doctoral thesis in ancient Greek studies in the UK and Republic of Ireland (1988).},

abstract = {Mode of interaction between the two autonomous and independent political units on the same level, located next to each other. The interaction include: imitation, eulation, competition, warfare, exchange of material goods and interaction. The dominance of one polity over another is not focal point of this approach, alyhough it is one of the possible modes of contact. Autonomous unit: village, tribal unit, chiefdom, city, state, empire. The term polity is not dependent on the level of social complexity of the autonomous political-unit. The polity - the highest form of socio-political organisation in the given region (often village or tribe). More complex polities have form of social hierarchy - they may consist of old polities that merged under one authority. Polity does not need ot be distinguished by developed system of governmnet or administration. The procedures of decision making have to habitually work, and such decisions have to be respected by the members of the polity. The adjacent small polities often share a number of features: language, symbolic systems, including belief, therefore they are not easily recoverable by means of archaeology. Change is caused by internal or external factors (endogenous and exogenous agent): Exogenous: diffusion of culture, core/periphery. Endogenous: internal growth etc. Peer polity: between the two, the change is happening within the polity, but it has effect also to neighbourhooding polities. The changes are more or less contemporary, and it is hard to track the original polity (the= single locus of innovation). Such changes include architectural style, conceptual systems of commmunication information (writing, system of measures), assemblages of specific and special artefacts which may be associated with high status in the society in question, customs (ritual practices). The mode of interaction: a) competition and competitive emulation b) symbolic entrainment, transmission of innovation c) increased flow in the exchange of goods. Nature of interactions: * warfare * competitive emulation - display of wealth and power to achieve higher inter-polity status, immitation of neighbour in a greater manner, conspicuous consumption and display * symbolic entrainment - developed symbolic system adopted by other the less developed one, writing, systems of measures, social organisation, political system, adopted to bring an advantage and prestige. * transmission of innovation - innovations not of a symbolic nature, technology * increased flow and exchange of goods - import, creation of new institutions to cope with the reception, allocation and distribution; craft specialization},
